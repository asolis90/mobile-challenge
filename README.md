# Mobile Developer Challenge

## Challenge

Create an iOS or Android application that displays information received over the network.

The app will be using [The Movie Database API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api). Follow the steps in their site to get an API Key. 

You are free to use any libraries you see fit for this project.

We would like the app to display:

#### Main Screen
- Home Tab:
  - Should display an scrollable carousel with `Now Playing` movies and below display a list of `Most Popular` or `Highest rated` movies. Both carousel and list items should be clickable and trigger the Movie Details Screen. In each item display thumbnail, title and genre of the movie.

- Favorites Tab:
  - Save favorite movies for viewing when offline. List should be clickable and trigger Movie Details Screen.

#### Movie Details Screen
- Show movie specific data such as title, released date, rating, overview, trailers and reviews(if there are any).
- Show a button to save movie to favorites.
