# Mobile Developer Challenge

## Challenge

Create an iOS or Android application that displays information received over the network.

The app will be using [The Movie Database API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api).

Steps to get API Key:
* Signup for an account
* Verify Email address
* Sign in and go to: https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api
* Click on Generate a new API key. Generate the API Key type as Developer
* Follow steps and fill out any information needed.


**NOTE:** Don't be afraid to be creative. You are free to use any libraries you see fit for this project.

We would like the app to display:

#### Main Screen
- Home Tab:
  - Should display an scrollable carousel with `Now Playing` movies and below display a list of `Most Popular` or `Highest rated` movies. Both carousel and list items should be clickable and trigger the Movie Details Screen. In each item display thumbnail, title and genre of the movie.

- Favorites Tab:
  - Displays a list of the movies that the user has marked as 'favorites'. This list should be persisted for viewing even when offline. The list item should be clickable and trigger MovieDetailsScreen. The user should be able to remove a movie from their favorites list.

#### Movie Details Screen
- Show movie specific data such as title, released date, rating, overview, trailers and reviews(if there are any).
- Provide a button to save the movie to favorites.
